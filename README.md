# FitnessRecipes
This application was built using an API from Spoonacular. I have used a single endpoint with different parameters to return recipes based off selection and user input. 

### `How To Run`
I recomend using the Live Server extension in VS code to run. You will need an API key from Spoonacular to test the functions. Or ask for mine if this is 
work experience related.
