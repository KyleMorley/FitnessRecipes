# FitnessRecipes
This application was built using an API from Spoonacular. I have used a single endpoint with different parameters to return recipes based off selections(provided in header at breakpoint) and user input via the search. The app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The overall objective was of the project is to focus on returning random recipes to the user from a fitness perspective. 

## Tech
JavaScript
CSS
HTML

# Limitations
If re-using this project, an API_KEY can be obtained by signing up at https://spoonacular.com. Using the free tier of the API, I have purposely left my key out of this respository as only 150 requests can be made per day. If your'e unfamiliar with using an API, replace all instances of ${ API_KEY } with your key, within app.js to run a working version of the application.
